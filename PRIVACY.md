# Privacy Policy for Azix

**Last Updated:** December 25, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data Azix ("the Bot") collects and how it is used.

## 1. Data We Collect
Azix collects the minimum amount of data required to function:
- **Discord User IDs:** To identify who requested a song or executed a command.
- **Discord Guild (Server) IDs:** To maintain music queues and settings specific to your server.
- **Voice Channel States:** To determine if the Bot should join or leave a channel.

## 2. How We Use Data
- **Functionality:** To play music, manage queues, and display "Requested By" information.
- **Debugging:** Temporary logs may be generated to fix errors (e.g., failed song loads), but these are not permanently stored.

## 3. Data Storage
Azix does not persist user data in a database. All queue data is stored in temporary memory (RAM) and is wiped immediately when the Bot restarts or leaves a voice channel.

## 4. Third-Party Sharing
We do **not** sell, trade, or share your data with third parties.
However, when you play a song, the Bot sends a query to content providers (YouTube/Spotify) to fetch the audio. These providers may collect data according to their own privacy policies.

## 5. Your Rights
Since we do not store persistent user data, there is typically no data to delete. However, if you have privacy concerns, you may kick the Bot from your server, which immediately halts all data processing for that server.

## 6. Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
