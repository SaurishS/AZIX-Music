# Terms of Service for Azix

**Last Updated:** December 25, 2025

By inviting Azix ("the Bot") to your Discord server or using its features, you agree to the following Terms of Service.

## 1. Usage License
Azix is provided "as-is" for personal and non-commercial use on the Discord platform. You may use the Bot to play music and manage voice channels in your server.

## 2. Limitations
You may not:
- Use the Bot for any illegal purposes or to violate Discord's Terms of Service.
- Attempt to exploit, reverse engineer, or abuse the Bot's infrastructure.
- Spam commands or intentionally degrade the Bot's performance.

## 3. Availability & Warranty
The Bot is provided without warranty of any kind. While we strive for 100% uptime, we are not liable for any service interruptions, data loss (such as cleared queues), or audio quality issues.

## 4. Third-Party Services
Azix interacts with third-party services (YouTube, Spotify, Genius). We are not affiliated with these services, and your use of the Bot is also subject to their respective Terms of Service.

## 5. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## 6. Contact
For questions or concerns, please contact the developer via GitHub.
